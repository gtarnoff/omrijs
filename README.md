# Motion Detector

A javascript library designed to give the user control over animations.

## To Use

1) Include the js file in the head of the document.
2) Set all animations to only run when the parent class of 'animate' is found on
the body. 
3) Design all animations so that the final "read" state is what the page looks
like when there is not animate class

The JS will inject a toggle before any content defaulted to off. When a use
clicks the toggle to on, the animations will play.
